Introduction

This document contains the analysis, insights, and recommendations obtained from the Power BI report using the life expectancy dataset. The report visualizes average life expectancy, covering multiple dimensions such as economic factors, mortality factors etc.

Problems/ Questions

This report is aimed at answering the following questions:
1. What is the average life expectancy across the 192 countries, and over a 15-year period? 
2. What is the average life expectancy in developed and developing countries?
3. What is the effect of economic factors like GDP, income per resources and expenditure affect life expectancy globally?
4. What is the effect of mortality and lifestyle on life expectancy?

Key Insights

Average Life Expectancy by Status, Continent and Year

The analysis found that developed countries have an average life expectancy of 78.69 years (53.76%) while developing countries have a lower average life expectancy of 67.69 years (46.24%). Also, Europe has the highest life expectancy at 77 years, followed by Latin America (76), North America (74), South America (72), Oceania (70), Asia (70), and Africa at the lowest with 61 years. Furthermore, the total of the population of 192 countries surveyed is 24 billion, and the total GDP is 9.18 million. Finally, there was a general upward trend in global life expectancy from 68 years in 2000 to 71.4 years in 2015. A slight dip occurred in 2005 to 68.3 years, followed by steady improvements.

Economic Breakdown per Continent

Europe leads in GDP contribution with 5.2M, followed by Asia at 1.2M. Other continents such as Africa, North America, and South America have significantly lower GDPs, indicating economic disparities across regions. Latin America contributes the least, with a total GDP of just 0.1M, showing a potential need for economic development initiatives in that region.
Furthermore, Africa has the highest total expenditure at 2.8B, closely followed by Europe with 2.5B and Asia with 2.1B. These figures suggest high spending on goods, services, or infrastructure across these continents. Europe tops the chart with the highest total income (299.93B), followed by Asia (251.57B) and Africa (249.57B). This indicates strong income-generating activities across these continents, with Latin America registering the lowest (10.47B). This income distribution suggests a potential gap in wealth accumulation and income distribution across regions.

Mortality & Lifestyle Breakdown Per Continent

The majority of alcohol consumption is observed in Europe, contributing to 3.55% of the total, followed by Oceania (1.43%) and Africa (0.87%). Also, Africa has a significant number of reported HIV/AIDS cases, with 3.0K cases, which greatly surpasses other continents where HIV/AIDS cases are near negligible (0.1K for Asia and no significant data for others). This indicates a severe disparity in healthcare challenges related to HIV/AIDS, with Africa being the most affected continent. 
Moreover, Africa leads in adult mortality with 127K deaths, including 18K infant deaths and 28K deaths of children under five. Asia follows with 61K adult deaths, 3K infant deaths, and 41K child deaths. Europe and Oceania have lower mortality rates, with Europe reporting 17K adult deaths and lower figures for infant and child mortality. Latin America shows the lowest figures, with negligible adult, infant, or child deaths recorded. These figures highlight significant public health challenges in Africa and Asia, particularly in child mortality, which may reflect disparities in healthcare access and quality.

Recommendations

•	Focus on Africa

Africa has the lowest life expectancy at 61 years. The analysis revealed that Africa spends twice their income increasing poverty on the continent. Also, Africa was the continent with the highest HIV/AIDS cases, highest adult mortality, second highest infant mortality and second largest infant under five mortalities. This points to poor healthcare systems and public health awareness. It is recommended that we further investment in healthcare infrastructure and disease prevention programs in African nations.

•	Improvement in Developing Countries

Life expectancy in developing countries lags behind developed nations. Implementing programs aimed at improving healthcare, education, and sanitation could help bridge this gap.

•	Addressing the 2005 Decline

The dip in life expectancy around 2002 to 2005 and especially 2003 explains the HIV/AIDS pandemic discovered in the early 2000’s and the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. It is recommended that we investigate global weather conditions to better prepare and reduce causalities.

•	Long-Term Trend Monitoring

Since life expectancy has shown consistent growth, continuing to monitor this trend year-on-year can help track the impact of global health interventions and identify emerging challenges.
